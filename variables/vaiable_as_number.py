# There are four types of variables in the varibales as number data types and these are:
#     1. integer
#     2. float
#     3. complex
#     4. boolean

# variables as integer:

x = 10
print(type(x)) 

# variable as flaot:

y = 10.23
print(type(y))  

# variables as complex:

y = 3j
print(type(y))

#variables as boolean

y = 10 > 8
print(type(y))
print(y)
