# OOP concept are three kinds:
#     1. Inheritance
#     2. Encapsulation
#     3. Abstruction
#     4. Polymorpism

# 1. Inheritance:
    # * A class can inherit attributes and behaviour methods from another class, called the superclass
    # * A class which inherit from a superclass is called a subclass, also called their child class or heir class.
